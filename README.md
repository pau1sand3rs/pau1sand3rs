I use this GitHub repository primarily to organize my TidalCycles code here. For over a year, I coded dozens of experiments (not sure if "songs" or even "music" applies to this), and the scale of text files littering my hard drive has dictated a new approach.

On the professional side of things, I'm a consultant with experience in digital strategy, digital marketing and analysis. I utilize Agile and Lean approaches in my work.

If you aren't familiar with TidalCycles, here is some info: https://tidalcycles.org/Welcome
